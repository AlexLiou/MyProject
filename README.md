# MyProject
An app to demonstrate all the skills I learned in 100 Days of SwiftUI. A project tracker app that utilizes Core Data to handle the CRUD operations and will be integrated with StoreKit, Apple Pay, and more. 

This is a complete iOS app to track projects and items.

Core Data is used to track all our user data and iCloud to share that data across devices.

All strings are localized and UI was made accessible.

Code reorganized into MVVM.

Added SwiftLint rules and code compiles without warnings.

Written unit tests, performance tests, and UI tests.

# Prequisites
Project was built in Xcode v13.4.1 in Swift 5. No third party framework required.
